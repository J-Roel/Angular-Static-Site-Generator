    - Can create an object representation of the local file structure based on reading the DOM.
    - Directory setup to use a category tag with the attribute "name" representing the name of category, to grab and display a list from said category.
    - folder structure is setup similar to wintersmith in that each directory represents the post, and each folder(post) has an index.md
    - The post index file can be written in HTML or markdown, but must be saved as index.md.
    - Markdown will be converted to HTML (showdown.js)
    - Lists will be displayed based on postListNum in Blog controller
